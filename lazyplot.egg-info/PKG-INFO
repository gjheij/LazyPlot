LazyPlot
========
linescanning is a package specifically built for the analysis of line-scanning
fMRI data. The idea is to acquire line data based on earlier acquired popu-
lation receptive field (pRF) data and minimal curvature in the brain, for
which we acquire functional runs with pRF-mapping and high resolution ana-
tomical scans that are processed with fmriprep, pRFpy, and FreeSurfer.

To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
repository README_.
